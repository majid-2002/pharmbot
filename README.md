# PharmBot: Automating Medicine Orders via WhatsApp

PharmBot is a WhatsApp bot designed to streamline the medication ordering process for both pharmacists and patients. By leveraging AI for prescription recognition and automating order workflows, PharmBot enhances efficiency, accuracy, and convenience.

## Features:

- **Prescription Recognition:** Utilizing AI, PharmBot can accurately recognize medication names from uploaded prescription images.
- **Order Automation:** Automates the entire order process, from creating a list of medications to confirming the order with the patient.
- **Seamless Communication:** Facilitates communication between patients and pharmacists through the familiar WhatsApp interface.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Reduces manual tasks for pharmacists, allowing them to focus on patient care and other critical responsibilities.
- **Enhanced Convenience:** Provides patients with a convenient and accessible way to order medications.

## Limitation:

- **Safety and Control:** As PharmBot deals with medical prescriptions, safety is paramount. Pharmacists have the ability to modify medication details as needed, ensuring accurate and safe prescriptions.

## How it Works:

1. **Patient uploads a prescription image:** The patient sends a photo of their prescription to the PharmBot via WhatsApp.
2. **AI recognizes medication names:** The bot's AI algorithms identify and extract medication names from the prescription image.
3. **Order list creation:** PharmBot generates a list of the medications and sends it to the patient for confirmation.
4. **Order confirmation and processing:** Once the patient confirms the order, PharmBot sends the information to the pharmacy for processing and fulfillment.
5. **Communication and updates:** The bot keeps the patient informed about the order status and provides a channel for communication with the pharmacist if needed.
